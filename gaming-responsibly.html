                To begin with, are you addicted? It’s always a difficult question to answer. If you’re not sure, take this quick, anonymous test and discover what the findings indicate. Please keep in mind that until you take an honest look at yourself, it is very difficult to identify whether or not you have an addiction.

                <br> <br>
                If you think you may have a gambling issue, you should take the necessary steps to suspend or remove your account until you find a solution. Instead of suspending or canceling your account, if you would rather better manage your gaming habits and expenditures, you can choose to impose limits on your deposits, losses, wagers, and session durations.

                <br> <br>
                We provide you numerous options for limiting your playtime. Limits placed on your account or bets cannot be removed for your own protection. You must wait at least 24 hours after requesting the lowering of the restriction before you may do so. The rise in limitations will have immediate impact. Go to the “Settings” page of your profile to set the following restrictions.

                    It’s fun to play the slots. Never think of it as a way to get money; Avoid trying to “recover” your losses by limiting the amount of money and time you can spend gaming. Observe these limitations;

                <li>
                    Never borrow money to place a wager; If you believe you won’t be able to stop in time, never be hesitant to ask for help;
