                        <p class="">A group of wagerers operating as a syndicate made wagers with the goal of exceeding the bookmaker’s limit and working together with other wagerers to obtain an unfair advantage through bonus schemes or other promos we might be running.

                        <p class="">The bettor may be using rogue devices, software, or analytical systems, such as software that allows you to place bets without the need for human intervention (like bots); or they may be using specialized hardware or software that makes automated betting possible. These could include using bugs, errors, or glitches in our software in relation to the services we offer, including betting.

                        <p class="">Any kind of unfair technique was used to obtain information or get above the company’s limitations. The organization’s management retains the right, at its sole discretion, to request from the bettor any documentation proving their identity or any other information they may have provided (such their residential address or passport data). They might even decide not to pay until each of these data has been verified.

                        <p class="">The company’s management reserves the right to request that the documents be sent to them via mail or to arrange a video conference as a means of conducting an identity verification process. Up to 72 hours may pass after the documents are received before they are verified. Within five working days after the video chat, the customer can obtain the results. If it is determined that the submitted data is fake, the company is entitled to take any reasonable action, including but not limited to canceling all bets and halting all transactions while they carry out their investigation. They can proceed with the entire account verification after requesting any papers required for the verification procedure.

Furthermore, the management shall have the right to take any reasonable action, including but not limited to blocking the account and freezing the available funds, until the account holder is identified and their deposit methods are confirmed.

The secondary account(s) may be blocked or terminated by the corporation at its discretion, depending on the severity of the infraction in each case.
